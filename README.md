# DrNUM

## Documentation
This GitHub repository will serve as the central place for DrNUM documentation. It will contain several things:

1. user documentation as a GitHub wiki ([here](https://github.com/enGits/drnum-doc/wiki))
2. example cases which can be downloaded in order to learn how to use DrNUM

## Software
The massively parallel CFD code DrNUM is being developed as a joint venture between numrax GmbH and enGits GmbH. DrNUM offers high fideltity CFD on very affordable hardware. 

## Licence and Pricing
It will soon be released under a propriatery licence. After an initial test phase, the code will be available on a pay per use basis. Thus there will be no upfront investments required. We believe that a first beta version of DrNUM will be released before the end of 2016. At the same time we will also anounce the future pricing model.
